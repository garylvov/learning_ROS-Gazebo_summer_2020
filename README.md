I made presentations documenting my learning in the summer of 2020 that roughly correspond to each folder:

### Starting_turtle_sim:

### learning_tf2:

### learning_gazebo-urdf:

https://tinyurl.com/27vmntpe
### learning_robot_control:

Since I've compiled several old repos that I created that summer into this single repo,and deleted the old repos, 
the links to my source code in the presentations don't work anymore.

I've intentionally left the old non-functioning links to preserve the "last edit was on" timestamp on the presentations.
