# learning_ROS-Gazebo_summer_2020

I made presentations documenting my learning in the summer of 2020 that roughly correspond to each folder:

Since I've compiled several old repos that I created that summer into this single repo,and deleted the old repos, 
the links to my source code in the slides don't work anymore.

I've intentionally left the old non-functioning links to preserve the "last edit was on" timestamp for the presntations.
